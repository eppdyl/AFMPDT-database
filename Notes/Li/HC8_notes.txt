The pressure was reported to drop while firing due to lithium gettering. The lowest pressure is therefore assumed.

The voltage data cannot be correlated to the individual data points, but all the data presented is 43 +- 2 V.

The magnetic field reported is at the anode face, not at the cathode tip.
