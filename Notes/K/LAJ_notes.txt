The pressure isnâ€™t always given. When it is first reported in a given run, it is assumed here that all previous measurements are at the same pressure. When it is last reported for a given run it is assumed that all subsequent measurements in that run are at the same pressure. When there is a gap between pressure reportings, a linear interpolation is assumed. When no pressure is given for a run, it is assumed to be 1 torr. On p. 22 of AFAPL-1965-06, they claim that pressures of 10^-5 torr were achieved with lithium, but hard to maintain. These low pressures are never listed in the data tables where thrust data are present.

The thrust error is assumed on page 29 of AFAPL-1965-06 to be 1 gram. On page 40 of AFAPL-1967-01, they say their new thrust stand is more accurate, but not how much. 1 gram is still used as the upper limit here.

On page 54 of AFAPL-1965-06, the magnetic field strength conversion is given as B=(0.5/2000)I.

Data is only recorded here when there was no mixture of propellants
