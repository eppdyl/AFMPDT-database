I emailed Sasoh for the JPP 92 data shown in Fig. 3 that lacks all of the info necessary to make an entry. He said that a digital file of the data does not exist any longer.

The error is found on page 99 of JPP-1992-8-1 in the caption of Fig. 3. It is 0.3% for efficiency, which makes it the same (as an upper bound) for thrust. I don’t know what is meant by “probable” error.
